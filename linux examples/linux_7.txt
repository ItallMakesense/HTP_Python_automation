"""
Write a script that will perform automated installation of Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) and latest Python 2.x from the official web site

o   You can get latest JRE TGZ from http://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=211989

o   Preliminary steps for JRE installation you can find here http://tecadmin.net/install-java-8-on-centos-rhel-and-fedora/ or ask @Google

Make sure the previous JRE is removed before the new one gets installed.

Make sure you stop any running java services before removing JRE, same is for Python.

After all installations print out to the terminal Java and Python versions and installation results.

 

*[extra task] how about handling Ubuntu?

We would use that script for our own purpose, so please make sure you add all possible checks and validations J
