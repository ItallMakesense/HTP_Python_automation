Schedule Apache to start every week day at 11AM and stop the service at 9PM that day.

Schedule Apache to start every weekend at noon and stop the service at 1 hour before midnight that day.

Yes, make sure I have Apache server installed, if no â€“ please let the script install it (on any Linux system you know), make sure its auto start is disabled (just in case).

Let the script inform me (with screen message) if previously installed Apache server was removed from the system by someone.

Have the main script take an optional argument as IP, to store logs in /tmp directory for that remote machine (suggest the you know the username, and you have ssh keys synced).

For convenience, you can use port forwarding and Putty to access your Linux VMs from Windows.

 

*[extra task]

Log all the actions somewhere in $HOME

If the day is Friday, make sure all apache PIDs priority bumped up +10 points or by the number supplied as the argument to the script.

If it is weekend, make sure all apache PIDs priority is lowered by 10 points or by the number supplied as the argument to the script.
