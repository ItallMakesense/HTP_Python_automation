In console run command: python -c “import this”;

Grab the output you get, and assign it to a string variable, let’s say “L” in a new python script (you can just copy-paste the text manually);

Take your personal email as a second string and concatenate it with L;

Print the length of L;

Print the count all the vowels in L;

Print each 18th symbol of the string, but do it in case opposite to the original (print A if the letter is a, print a if A etc.) adding the position of that letter in the string in format like:

o   18,

o   36E

o   54

o   72I

o   …
