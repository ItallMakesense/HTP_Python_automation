On the CentOS VM you have previously installed:

Make sure that when you log in to shell, you have a script that produces a file named <logs_with 1>, with the following content:

o   Detailed information of files, directories and their permissions from /var/log directory, and their lines must match “1” at any position;

o   Lines that contain “.2” must be excluded;

o   Always include info about directories “..” and “.” in the <logs_with 1> file, no matter if they contain “1” or ”.2” (date, time, whatever);

o   The “logs_with 1” file must be replaced with the fresh one each time your log in;

 

Use any utility you would need: cat, grep, sort, pipes and redirections… à click for a hint or reminder

Please mind EXACT and literally matched file name, inside <> brackets.

 

Capture three screenshots with “logs_with 1” content after logging in an running the script every ~2 minutes.

Send all the screenshots attached by the time and date above. Send me the details of how did you perform that task (shell code/files).

Send the response with a reply to this message, preserving the Subject.
