·         Download at http://ftp.byfly.by/pub/CentOS/6.8/isos/i386 and install in VirtualBox CentOS 6 Minimal ISO (354 Mb)

·         Be aware that allocated RAM <= 512MB will start installation off in text mode only. More of RAM will switch installation to GUI.
Mind auto-enabling network connection at boot time (an option during the setup)

·         During installation create 3 partitions (try to use classic partitioning table, do not use LVM):

o   Swap, with capacity of 700Mb

o   Partition with “root” mount point, capacity of 6Gb

o   Separate partition with capacity of 10Gb for /home mount point

·         When the system is installed, run commands:

o   “df -lh” – capture the screenshot;

o   “mount” – capture the screenshot;

o   “lsblk” – capture the screenshot;

o   “free -h” – capture the screenshot;

Capture the VM snapshot (you will need this VM till almost the end of the course)
