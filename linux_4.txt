"""
Install Jenkins on both of your CentOS and Ubuntu VMs, expanding corresponding repositories with https://jenkins.io/ sources.

Send me the screenshots of modified repos configs and post-installation bash messages.

Make sure you have two VMs installed at home, connected with Host-only network adapters (see the guide in case http://rus-linux.net/MyLDP/vm/VirtualBox-networking.html)

Practice a bit in building your own virtual networks. Create SSH keys for both of the VMs, and make passwordless access between them (http://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/)

Prove with a screenshots that you are not asked for password at remote login.

* How about sshfs as an extra task? How do I tie two VMs ~/SSHFS directories with it?
"""

Extra:
1) mkdir SSHFS's at both VM's (at home ~ dir)
2) sudo sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions root@192.168.56.3:/root/SSHFS ~/SSHFS
3) bounded.
